> But there is something fundamentally different about talking with a bot as opposed to a person. A person can be a friend. An AI cannot be a friend, despite how people might treat it or react to it. AI is at best a tool, and at worst a means of manipulation. Humans need to know whether we’re talking with a living, breathing person or a robot with an agenda set by the person who controls it. That’s why robots should sound like robots.

An interesting policy recommendation. We always have to decide how we want to regulate technology, and generative AI poses some uniquely interesting problems. This seems like a sensible artificial constraint!
